For this project I had complications running the program without using 'dotenv'. If there is an issue with having to set your enviornment to run this applications please email me jakelee631@gmail.com 

I've included a .env file where all you need to do is include your own information into it to run the program. 
Feel free to edit the program to have it run in a different way, but this was the only way for me to run this on my machine.
